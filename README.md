# unreal_sims

The goal for this project is to realistic ground motion response for standard objects in physics environment.
Initial work is to define an environment, import shapes, and assign material type, weight dimension to obtains approximate response.
Once the reponse looks approximate, test against known ground motions into a testing device.
both video of known objects, and example animations.

## Development Directions:
The location where the shaking is happening should be visually identifiable as site specific. Background from maps or traffic to georeference where the ground motions are.
